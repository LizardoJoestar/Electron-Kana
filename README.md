# Electron-Kana

Project for GestiÃ³n de Proyectos de Software class. Made with Electron and Node.js, to aid in the pratice of japanese kana.

**Notes:**
- This repo doesn't have the 'electron' folder, due to it being too large (has a file >100MB). You'll have to have it already on your computer by installing electron with npm, and moving the folder to 'node_modules'
